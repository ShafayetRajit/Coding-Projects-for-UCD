# Molecular-fingerprint-based-QSAR-Analysis-for-3clpro

This project explores molecular-fingerprint-based QSAR modeling using augmented SMILES to improve prediction of biological activity.
- Data: 198 compounds collected from ChEMBL, expanded via SMILES enumeration to balance the dataset (720 inactive, 701 active).
- Approach: Tested six machine learning algorithms with twelve fingerprint descriptor methods.
- Results: Random Forest achieved the best performance with >90% accuracy and precision. The Substructure Count descriptor proved most efficient, reaching 90.15% accuracy with low computational complexity.
